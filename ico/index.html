            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in
            his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head
            a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
            The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many
            legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
            looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
            although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of
            textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it
            there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
            gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a
            heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to
            look out the window at the dull weather. Drops
        </p>
